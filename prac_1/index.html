                        Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc 
                        Tarpenning.Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of 
                        directors as its chairman. Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating 
                        conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[91][124] Musk assumed leadership of the company 
                        as CEO and product architect in 2008, positions he still holds today.<br>
                        Tesla's "master plan", as iterated by Musk in 2006 was:
                        <blockquote>
                            Build sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that money to build an even more 
                            affordable car. While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options.
                        </blockquote>

                        solar city etc. But we will limit our disscussion with above major milestones of
                        Elon Musk.
